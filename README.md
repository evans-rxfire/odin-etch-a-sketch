Grid squares are generated with for loops; one generating the required number of squares per row, and the other the required rows. 
This approach seemed easier than trying to generate the total amount of sqaures needed then arranging them in the right positions. 

I used an eventListener to change the backgroundColor of the squares.

I also have created the button a small amount of text for explanation.



To do:

add eventListener to button that generates a prompt for teh user to enter a number up to 100.

write a function that takes that number, and creates a grid os squares the required size

adjust size of squares to fit into the grid-container
